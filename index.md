  - *Small tile-based game I was building from scratch. Maybe I'll get back to it some day. The magic system is conway's game of life, click to use magic on a tile, try and draw 3 tiles in a vertical line and see it unfold. Avoid the slimes. There's 4 spells, water heals you and gives you mana so make an infinite structure of it early to retreat to. Save the html file to play locally, everything is self-contained including the tileset (hurray base64). PgUp/PgDn rotate spells, Arrow keys move.*
