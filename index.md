  - *Break pictures in cool ways using Audacity/Irfanview*
- [Streaming on Discord](Guides/Streaming/StreamingOnDiscord.md)
  - *Really this is a guide for if you're still not win 10 and the discord streaming feature doesn't capture audio and it'd be more accurate to say this is "how to redirect the audio of an app/tab to my microphone"*

### Fun
- [Slime Arena](/GameEngine/SlimeArenaCurrent/SlimeArena.html) 
  - *Small tile-based game I was building from scratch. Maybe I'll get back to it some day. The magic system is conway's game of life, click to use magic on a tile, try and draw 3 tiles in a vertical line and see it unfold. Avoid the slimes. There's 4 spells, water heals you and gives you mana so make an infinite structure of it early to retreat to. Save the html file to play locally, everything is self-contained including the tileset (hurray base64). PgUp/PgDn rotate spells, Arrow keys move.*
