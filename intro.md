## Hello.

This is just a showcase of some of my personal projects. Use the menu on the left to explore them. 

If you'd like to explore the rest of my repos, <a href="https://github.com/read-0nly" target="_blank">click here!</a>

Right now, because most pages are actually markdown, there's a few spots that give XSS errors - right-click and open in new tab. Slowly going through and replacing them with proper links with blank targets.

[Also I make music sometimes](https://nullzer0.bandcamp.com)
