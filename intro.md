## Hello.

This is just a showcase of some of my personal projects. Use the menu on the left to explore them. 

If you'd like to explore the rest of my repos, <a href="https://github.com/read-0nly" target="_blank">click here!</a>

Right now, because most pages are actually markdown, there's a few spots that give XSS errors - right-click and open in new tab. Slowly going through and replacing them with proper links with blank targets.

Want to try out the worst idea I've had yet? Pop this into powershell to connect to PSNet, a set of scripts meant to be accessed directly from the web.
