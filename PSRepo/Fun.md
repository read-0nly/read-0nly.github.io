[AnimatedTextExample](https://github.com/read-0nly/PSRepo/blob/master/Fun/AnimatedTextExample.ps1)

Absolutely useless, shows an approach to animated text using a refresh loop (mostly as a platform to explain loops to a friend)


[MeteorGame](https://github.com/read-0nly/PSRepo/blob/master/Fun/MeteorGame.ps1) 

Started out to explain some programming concepts to a friend, but it ended up actually being kinda fun so I kept working on it.
Shoot the meteors, don't let a single one slip past you and don't get hit.
